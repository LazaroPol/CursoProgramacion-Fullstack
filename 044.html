<h2>position: static;</h2>

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="static">
This div element has position: static;
</div>

<div class="relative">
    This div element has position: relative;
    </div>

    <h2>position: fixed;</h2>

<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
</div>
<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

<div class="relative02">This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute02">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>
